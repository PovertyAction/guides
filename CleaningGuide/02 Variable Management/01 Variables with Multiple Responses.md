# Variables with Multiple Responses
Some surveys questions have the option of “check all that apply”, meaning that they allow for multiple responses. SurveyCTO exports these variables as a string containing all possible answers in the form of a space-separated list (e.g., a variable may have the string “A C E” to indicate responses of A, C, and E). For analysis purposes, it’s usually best to split these variables into binary variables, one for each possible choice (A, B, C, D, or E), as well as one for each combination of choices. The IPA-written `stringdum` function can help converting these variables to a more useful form, including separate dummies for each option, variables that count the number of times each option is selected, and several options for naming conventions. The split command also will parse on spaces and can split these variables up. If this is not sufficient, check out Stata’s string functions. You can also use the regexm fuction to accomplish this. Below is an example script using both split and regexm to accomplish cleaning a select multiple question.
