# Quality Control 

Once youâ€™ve finished cleaning a dataset, take some time to inspect the final product by using a command like `codebookout`. This command outputs an excel file that is a codebook of your final data including variable names, labels, types, values and value labels. Check that variables are labeled and take on a range of values that make sense. 

Another helpful command in quality control is `assert`. You should include many asserts throughout your do files in order to check that your assumptions while cleaning hold. This is especially important if you are going to be collecting more data later. 

Finally, you can use the checklist in this folder to perform checks on your dataset.
