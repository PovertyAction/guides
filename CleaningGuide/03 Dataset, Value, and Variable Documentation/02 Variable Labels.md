# Variable Labels

Variable labels are best used as descriptors: they should say exactly what the variable is about. You can pull the exact question text from the survey, or use a paraphrased version if the text itself is quite lengthy. SurveyCTO automatically labels the variables using the questions from the survey instrument. However, labels are allowed a maximum of only 80 characters in Stata, which means that in many cases the labels imported from SurveyCTO will be truncated.  For tips on how to attach information that is longer than 80 characters see the [variable notes](https://github.com/PovertyAction/guides/blob/master/CleaningGuide/03%20Dataset%2C%20Value%2C%20and%20Variable%20Documentation/03%20Variable%20Notes.md) guide
