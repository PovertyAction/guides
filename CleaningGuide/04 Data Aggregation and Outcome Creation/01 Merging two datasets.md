# Merging two datasets
You may also need to merge two or more datasets together, if they are split by variables. For example, you may have variables that were split between two datasets by the survey program. Be sure that both datasets have a unique ID and be extra careful to specify whether the merge is one-to-one or one-to-many (see the `merge` options for how to specify this). A many-to-many merge is a really bad practice and should not be done. If you do this, you may inadvertently change the sample size of your dataset. After the merge, type `tab _merge` and check to see that the results (number of matches, number from master data only, and number from using data only) were what you expected. Adding a few assertions after the merge is good practice to make sure things are running correctly. There are a couple other merge command options that try to build in more safety features for you. You should look at the documentation for both `safemerge` and `mmerge` for alternative merge methods. 

See the IPA Stata beginnerâ€™s training manual for step-by-step guidance on how to `append` and `merge` datasets. The IPA high intermediate Stata training also has a helpful module on merging, including a discussion of common pitfalls.
