# Logic Tests
Logic tests check if the values observed in the data make sense given other values. For instance, can someone who says they were born in 2000 really have been a member of their current community for thirty years?

The list of logic tests to examine is not obvious; check for things that you think would be very problematic or that would clearly indicate that something was wrong with the data. Again, if any of those tests fail, flag the values and bring them up with the PIs.
